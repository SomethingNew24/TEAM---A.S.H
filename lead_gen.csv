"Customer service is very very Pathetic. Currently stuck and banging my head for opting Maxlife as my insurance partner. True colors starts showing up soon after the very first premium payment is done. Firstly they ask something on the application form, parses the information provided by the customer and publishes something else on the proposal form. Secondly the medical team fills up the questionnaire completely random fashion and they blame the customer for the fault of the medical team even though it is actually the customer who pin points the clerical errors. Customer team neither acknowledges the issue nor address the issues, they just keeps the customer guessing. More importantly even if they respond, new response will be tangential to all their earlier responses. Lastly they try to manipulate the customer on phone calls, and hardly conveys the same phone discussions on emails.",https://www.mouthshut.com/chidunitw,1

"One of the terrible experiences with this company. I took a forever young pension plan with this company and was told that after paying premiums for the lock in period of 5 years I could withdraw my amount if there was a necessity or retirement. Unfortunately the nightmare starts when you try to stop the policy and claim back your money, they have plenty of clauses to deprive you of your own hard earned money when you require it the most. they offered me 60% of my money and they want me to deposit the remaining 40% on another of their sham income plan where they defer my benefit payment for a year and then they pay me less than a bank deposit rates and that too with a clause that I cannot surrender this policy without losing 25% of the deposited money. I am forced to take this scheme to get back 60% of my own money and when I wasn't interested in any of their schemes or life insurance plans. The entire scheme is just a sham and just a ploy to prey on peoples deposits. My recommendation is for people to stay away from the sweet talking and unscrupulous - false promises when they are selling the policy and invest their hard earned money wisely into a reliable mutual fund or safer in to a Bank FD.",https://www.mouthshut.com/drcanand,1

Never everything think of taking policy form max life insurance they Just care for their money they direct debit the amount without customer consent after informing several times that we don't want to continue with the policy no proper follow ups for the queries raised and without talking with the customer they close the ticket and says query resolved..they do not approve your request of cancelling auto debits after several follow ups so think before buying max life insurance.,https://www.mouthshut.com/poojavnar,1
Dear all review readers I highly recommend you that,https://www.mouthshut.com/gzpmasoomashu,1
I have invested 3 lakhs now over the span of 6 years and wish to break my account and get my money back since I really think that their whole service is a scam . You can never reach their customer service number and there are thousands of reviews stating they haven’t got their money properly back . The last time I called their agent through my bank I was convinced to keep my money since it was a bad idea taking it out and losing 30+ percent but now I feel it’s better to lose that money and invest someplace else and you will still make more money than keeping it with them . So sad that they are working on such a large scale and robbing people from their hard earned money with a fake promise of giving back more! I don’t Know how are they legally doing this,https://www.mouthshut.com/perpetual1992,1

I perched the policy in 2010 at the time of purchasing agent told me it is very beneficial but after 10 years I found it was market plan and was totally money wasted.. when I approached the branch met a advisor wh assumed me that he would flip into another policy I agreed and money would come from old policy which money wouldn't decrease from old one but now I find value is decreasing from old policy .. I am not sure it is right or wrong after 13 years long trust...but some where in my mind it comes that I am badly cheated ..... I don't know should I continue my policy in this company or not even branch advisors didn't give the right advice dont know should I trust for moe years ?,https://www.mouthshut.com/jansidu30,1

"Never opt for max life, one of the worst team and they are good in giving wrong plans and suggest wrong information, if you cancelled the policy they says, they don't give your money back, it's better to cancel the policy and donate the money of investment to them as they love only customer money and with worst inexperienced team members . I don't have assurance that this investec money after 7 years, they will give to us Or not, hence to prevent the disturbance and nuisance from max life I decide to cancel policy, when doing policy they said you can cancel at anytime, now at tome of cancellation to avoid nuisance from these worst team of inexperienced pple, when I cancelled a guy called and he saying you will get zero amount and all money will go to company, I said I will think as I given my money to begging agency Max life insurance in order to avoid further investment to wrong team, enjoy Max life as u begging our money I throwing.
